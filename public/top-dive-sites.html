<h1>The Best DiveSites WorldWide - according to Marta</h1>
<h2>My top Divesites of all-dives.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pass St.Jacques</h3>
<h4>Mauritius, Le Morne</h4>
<p>I love it because of variety of mrine life, and unique character - you start inside the lagoon, and drift out of it with a current.</p>
<ul>
    <li>max depth: 30+ meters</li>
    <li>inaxessible during windy weather if winds from south, south-east</li>
    <li>you dive a reverse profile - start shallow and end up deeper in the second part of the dive</li>
    <li>high probability of turtle, eagle ray and reef shark encounters</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Astron Wreck</h3>
<h4>Dominican Republic, Bavaro</h4>
<p> Shalow dive site, with good weather for all experience levels. When the visibility is good (usually summer months) offers stunning views of the wreck and it's huge propeller. </p>
<ul>
    <li>max depth 15 meters - abd you need to dig to get to this</li>
    <li>not too much in terms of marine life, but the wreck is amazing</li>
    <li>penetration of main chamber only possible on realy calm days - therwise the water movement can be too intense</li>
    <li>typical marine life includes parrot fish, wrasse, morrays</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Santo Antao</h3>
<h4>Cape Verde, Sal Island</h4>
<p>The home of hundrets of puffer fish. It is literally impossible to count them on a single dive. </p>
<ul>
    <li>max depth 14 meters</li>
    <li>construction is becoming more and more unstable due to water movements - swimming through not advisable</li>
    <li>home to several species of uffer and porcupine fish</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>The Wall of Catalina Island</h3>
<h4>Dominican Republic, Catalina, Bayahibe</h4>
<p>Lovely carribean vibes ans abundance of marine live and corals.</p>
<ul>
    <li>max depth - over 60 meters</li>
    <li>tricky start in the shallow reef part - with boat traffic overhead</li>
    <li>sometimes quite a current along the wall - be careful to start agiants it</li>
    <li>have a good look out for lobsters on the wall</li>
</ul>
